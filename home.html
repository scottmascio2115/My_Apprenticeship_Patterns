    <h3  id='title'>Welcome!!<h3>
    <p id='hello'>
    My name is Scott Mascio and I am currently an apprentice at Neo Columbus. On this site you will find my blog posts describing my journey from trader on the Chicago Board of Trade to apprentice at Neo. More importantly I will share with you the lessons and experiences I have learned while being an apprentice at Neo.
    </p>
    <p id='hello'>
    Prior to becoming an apprentice at Neo I attended Dev BootCamp. At Dev BootCamp I read the book Apprenticeship Patterns, written by Dev BootCamp Chicago founder Dave Hoover. I have used his book as a reference during my apprenticeship. Each week I have noted how my experience&#39;s have related to the principles in the book. I try to reference three principles a week in each post. To the right is an outline of the principles mentioned, and how many posts they are referenced in.
    </p>
    <p id='hello'>
     Forgive me for any grammatical or spelling errors, I&#39;ll fix them if you send me a note or tweet me, thanks!

        My apprenticeship at Neo has finally started and I could not be happier. I accepted the position on January 3rd, and I have spent the last month and a half preparing both mentally and logistically for this new adventure. logistically, I bought a car, found an apartment in Columbus, and moved my stuff from Chicago to Columbus. These tasks seem small, but the time adds up, and I am happy everything fell into place.
      </p>
      <p>
      The mental part of my preparation was spent writing and reading as much code as possible. I kept sharp in Ruby on Rails by doing daily exercises. Additionally, through tutorials and watching presentations, I tried my best to learn Ember and Javascript. I also attended Codemash and read Dave Hoover&#39;s book Apprenticeship Patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
      Having a growth mindset entails a belief that you can be better and everything can be improved if you’re prepared to work at it. The book sums up a growth mindset by stating “effort is what makes you smart or talented.”  I strongly agree with having a growth mindset. This stems from my time spent as a college basketball player. At that level of play, everyone is tall, strong, and fast, and you quickly realize the players that separate themselves are the players that work the hardest and practice the most. This directly translates to programming. The harder I work at programming, the better I am at it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Emptying the cup is a concept of clearing your mind of the way you were taught or your previous views of how things should be done. By clearing your mind of how things should be done or the way you were taught, you leave yourself open to learn how your more experienced mentors and leaders would solve a problem or write code. This concept is interesting for me because my beliefs of how code should be written or what frameworks to use stem from my time at Dev BootCamp. I am very interested in how Neo accomplishes their goals and what frameworks and strategies Neo uses.
      </p>
      <p>
      Construct your curriculum is exactly what it sounds like: construct a curriculum of subjects you want to learn, and develop a plan to learn those topics; either through books, presentations, or conferences.
      </p>
      <p>
      During my apprenticeship, I want to keep these three concepts at the front of my mind and through this weekly retrospective, I will track my focus and progress. Each week I will give an example of how I stuck to the concept of each: growth mindset, emptying the cup, and construct your own curriculum. I will refrain from talking about my feelings or expressing how awesome people are at Neo. It is a given that I am super excited to be at Neo and everyone is great and incredibly helpful!
      </p>
      <p>
      My first assignment alongside James, the other apprentice, is to implement drag and drop feature onto the internal Lunch and Learn app. Neo uses the lunch and Learn app to plan lunch time talks every Tuesday and Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
      This was my first time taking a code base, reading through it, and figuring out what it does. The code base was rather extensive, and it took some time for James and I to "connect the dots" and figure out how every model and method connected to each other.
      </p>
      <div id='empty_1'>
      <p>
      This code base was a good example of <mark>emptying the cup</mark>. I tried to refrain from saying 'I would have made this app a different way' or 'lets change this to a way I was taught.' Keeping this open mindset the whole time was very beneficial, and I walked away with a better understanding of the different ways an app can be built.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div id='construct_1'>
      <p>
      The code base we were given used Slim. Slim is a lightweight template engine similar to Haml. I have no prior experience using Slim or Haml, and I really liked using both of them. It seems more people use Haml and I decided to <mark>construct a curriculum</mark> to learn Haml this week. In this curriculum, I explored the internet for code examples and articles talking about Haml.  I also created a Rails blog using haml forcing myself to write HTML in Haml. I also found that this HTML to Haml converter http://html2haml.heroku.com/  was a great resource.
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
      Writing tests for the Lunch and Learn app helped us discover a lot of bugs.  This one simple failing integration test caused us to overhaul the app database and schema design. James and I affectionately called this test the 'pizza test' :
      </p>
      <div id="code">
      <p>
     it 'should let you see the events if your are not signed in' do<br>
     <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
          factorygirl.create(:event)<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
          visit '/'<br><br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
          expect(page).to have_content 'pizza'<br>
    </p>
     end<br><br>

     Factory:<br><br>
     factorygirl.define do<br>
     <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
     factory :event do |f|<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
          f.title 'talk about ruby'<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
          f.description 'a talk about ruby'<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
          f.presenter 'james'<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
          f.scheduled_date date.new(2014,3,7)<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
          f.created_by 'scott'<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
          f.votes_count 1<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
          f.lunch 'pizza'<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
       end<br>
     </p>
     end<br>
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
      This test was failing and we were not sure why it was. After hours of debugging and placing binding.pry in various places of the code, we enlisted the help of Tony, a developer at Neo, to debug. We soon realized the query to find the event was returning nothing. The current schema was designed in such a way that in the event model, the scheduled_date property was a string and was then later being parsed into a date object using a date method in the event model. Why was the scheduled_date a string and not a date? This was because Sqlite3 was being used as the database and Sqlite3 does not set aside storage for storing dates and/or times. Logically, we figured scheduled_date should be a date. to accomplish this, we would have to use a database that does accept date objects.
      </p>
      <p>
      Postgresql does accept dates and we knew if we converted the database from Sqlite3 to Postgres we should be able to get this test to pass. Our task was to switch our database from Sqlite3 to Postgresql without loosing any data currently in the database.
      </p>
      <div id='growth_1'>
      <p>
      This is my example of a <mark>growth mindset</mark>. All this work just to get one test to pass? Why not just delete the test and forget about it? If our manual clicks throughout the app work, why care about this one test?
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
      We didn&#39;t know how to convert a database. Additionally, this task was not required by our mentors and could take all day. Fridays are suppose to be devoted to time spent developing our personal project. Having a growth mindset enabled me to realize that this was just the type of learning opportunity I was expecting and hoping for when I accepted the apprenticeship. The task would take additional effort but in the end I would have a better understanding of how to covert a database from Sqlite3 to Postgresql without losing the data.
      </p>
      <p>
      Tony, James, and I set out to convert the database a task that turned out to be not so difficult with Tony&#39;s help. First, we converted the gem file to include 'pg' as well as modified the config/database.yaml. Our last step was to create a new migration shown below.
      </p>
      <div id="code">
      <p>
     class changescheduleddatefromstringtodate < activerecord::migration<br><br>

     <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
      def up<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    add_column :events, :_scheduled_date, :date<br><br>
    </p>


     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    event.reset_column_information<br><br>
    </p>


     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    event.all.find_each do |event|<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 7em;">
      date_obj = date.parse(event.scheduled_date)<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 7em;">
      event.update_column(:_scheduled_date, date_obj)<br>
     </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    end<br><br>
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    remove_column :events, :scheduled_date<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    rename_column :events, :_scheduled_date, :scheduled_date<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
      end<br><br>
    </p>

     <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
      def down<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    add_column :events, :_scheduled_date, :date<br><br>
    </p>

     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    event.reset_column_information<br><br>
    </p>

     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    event.all.find_each do |event|<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 7em;">
      date_str = event.scheduled_date.strftime('%y-%m-%d')<br>
      </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 7em;">
      event.update_column(:_scheduled_date, date_str)<br>
      <p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    end<br><br>
    </p>


     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    remove_column :events, :scheduled_date<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
    rename_column :events, :_scheduled_date, :scheduled_date<br>
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
  end<br>
  </p>
end<br><br>
    rake db:migrate<br>
    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
      Let&#39;s run the pizza test. Failing! But why? Turns out, all our tests are failing now because throughout the code base, a date method that was previously used to parse the string version of the scheduled_date was being called instead of the new scheduled_date property. After refactoring our code and finally getting the infamous pizza test to pass, the day was over. It took all day to get the pizza test to pass, but in the process we learned many new skills and debugging strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
      My first week at Neo has come to an end. It was a successful one. James and I completed the task of implementing the drag and drop feature, and we also made tests using Rspec and Capybara with Selenium. I also stuck with my goal of sticking to the growth mindset, emptying the cup, and constructing a curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
      I am very much looking forward to next week!

      <div class='paragraph'>
        <p>
        Last week in my retrospective post on my first week as being a Neo apprentice, I talked about three principles from Dave Hoover&#39;s book, Apprenticeship Patterns. Those patterns were having a 'growth mindset', 'emptying the cup' and 'construct your curriculum.' In this post I will talk about 'exposing your ignorance', and will not talk about 'emptying the cup.'  At this point, my "cup" is empty and is being filled by all the great knowledge I am learning at Neo.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the book 'Apprenticeship Patterns', the concept of 'exposing your own ignorance' is best summed up by a quote from Jake Scruggs: 'Tomorrow I need to look stupider and feel better about it. This staying quiet and trying to guess what’s going on isn’t working so well.' As Dave Hoover explains, people instinctively hide their ignorance but this stunts their growth. There are many reasons why a person would hide their ignorance. Two reasons why I sometimes hide my ignorance is because I want to feel highly regarded by my peers and it is difficult to admit weaknesses. An individual, whether an apprentice or otherwise, needs to identify an area of ignorance and work to reduce it. From my personal experience, this is a very uncomfortable thing to do, especially if it is a topic that your peers assume you are knowledgeable about.
        </p>
        <p>
        I attended a Github talk on Monday at the Ohio State Technology Center that was a basic introduction to Github. The talk consisted of a walk through of how to create a repository, commit, and then pull down from that repository. These are topics that I am familiar with, but I still enjoyed the talk and engaging with all the enthusiastic Ohio State students.
        </p>
        <div id='ignorance_2'>
        <p>
        At the end of the talk, the person in front of me raised his hand and asked, "What is a pull request?" The instructor answered the question and I didn&#39;t think much of the whole thing.  After the talk, a person went up to the young man (I assume it was his friend) and said, "I cant believe you didn&#39;t know what a pull request was!?" The young man&#39;s response was, "Well now I know." I thought that his response was great and the interaction was a great illustration of <mark>exposing your own ignorance</mark>.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        I applaud the young man for asking a question that exposed his ignorance to a room full of people. His response after being questioned was even more impressive. It took just minutes for him to go from not knowing to knowing. He could have kept quiet and gone years before he knew what a pull request was, but it took seconds for his question to be answered.
        </p>
        <p>
        This week I forced myself to ask more questions and expose my ignorance. You might say scott = Apprentice.new,  scott.confused? ? scott.ask_question : scott.continue_working. Yes, it was uncomfortable, but not because the people at Neo scoffed at me for asking seemingly elementary questions; they are more then helpful. It was uncomfortable because exposing my ignorance hurts. I don't want to look like I don't know a topic and I want to be held in high regard by my new employer. I kept saying to myself, "just ask the question, and just like that you will go from not knowing to knowing."
        </p>
        <p>
        It was difficult for me to ask questions and expose my ignorance about migrating tables and developing a schema for my personal project. Now I know techniques and strategies used in Rails that I previously was not aware of. The only way I knew how to create and migrate tables was to create columns individually through separate migrations. Looking back, it seems silly to create tables that way and have dozens of migrations, but at the time it was the only way I knew. If you are thinking 'I can't believe you didnt know how to create table columns without individual migrations, my answer to that is 'Well now I know.'
        </p>
        <p>
        I also exposed my ignorance when being introduced to the T2 project. After going through a chalk talk and explanation about T2, James and I sat down and started going through the codebase. While looking at the Ember router, I told James that before we go any further I would like to ask Alex how the interaction between Ember and the Rails api works. I have never used a Rails back end with a Javascript framework front end, and I didnt have a clear understanding of how all the wires connected. Exposing my ignorance to the fundamental set up of an app wasn&#39;t easy, but Im glad I asked because now I know.
        </p>
        <p>
        I look forward to asking more and more questions and feeling comfortable with my ignorance and the learning process next week and throughout my apprenticeship.
        </p>
        <div id='construct_2'>
        <p>
        This week, I <mark>constructed my own curriculum</mark> by making a blog using Devise and Omni Auth. Devise is a generating engine that essentially creates all the controllers, methods, and views for users to login and logout, including the use of Bcrypt. Devise is great and very easy to use and has many tutorials to follow. Omni Auth is a more complex topic, but is simplified through the many tutorials on the internet. Omni Auth lets a user login via a third party such as Twitter or Facebook. I was able to let users of my blog sign in via Twitter. One of many things to remember when setting up omni auth is that the url callback from Twitter has to be your websites callback url. For my Rails blog that url was http:127.0.0.1:3000/user/auth/twitter/callback. The 127.0.01 replaces the localhost.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id='growth_2'>
        <p>
        My illustration of having a <mark>growth mindset</mark> is the infamous pizza test falling again on Monday morning. I installed Capybara Webkit onto the Lunch and Learn app to test the hover feature James and I put into the app, and that caused the pizza test to fail. By placing Pry throughout the app it was clear that the Event I was making with Factory Girl was not persisting. Capybara Webkit requires the use of a truncation database cleaner strategy. The installation and configuring of database cleaner is harder than one might think. I found a great walk through done by Avidi Grimm. In this post, he outlines each step in the process. http://devblog.avdi.org/2012/08/31/configuring-database_cleaner-with-rails-rspec-capybara-and-selenium/. One step he did not mention is if you are using Factory Girl sequences you need to add, FactoryGirl.reload into the config. That is with the pizza test it is passing….. for now.

    Week three is in the books and it was my most challenging week of my apprenticeship so far. I jumped onto the ICANN project, started to learn VIM, and I am at a stage in my personal project and with Ember that is both frustrating and rewarding.
    </p>
    <p>
    The ICANN project is essentially an update on ICANN's current website (which is in Drupal) to a new, better looking and cleaner Rails website. The project has a lot of moving parts and many people working on it. The project requires that the current information on ICANN's website be modified into JSON and pointed to models setup on the Rails side.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the most impressive things about Rails that I have learned since starting my apprenticeship is the many ways Rails can be used. Rails can be used as an API, as a stand alone framework pulling from a database, and it can also be configured to receive data and point that external data to models. For example, in the ICANN project, Rails is configured to receive external data. In my personal project, Rails is used as an API, and for the Lunch and Learn project, we used Rails with a traditional database. At the end of my apprenticeship, I am excited to know that I will have a better, more complete understanding of each way Rails can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
    As this is my first project I have worked on where I am part of a larger team, I didn&#39;t know how I would fit in or how to contribute. I looked to the book 'Apprenticeship Patterns' for guidance. In the principle 'Sweep the Floor', Dave Hoover answers the following problem: in the context of being a new apprentice on a project, you are unsure of your place on the team and the team is unsure of you. You wish to find a means of contributing to the team’s work, earning the team&#39;s trust, and growing in stature as a craftsman. The answer to this problem is to literally or figuratively sweep the floor; do the unglamorous tasks that no one else wants to do. Whether those acts are a code review or fixing small bugs. Do these tasks and do them to the highest of your ability. I tried my best this week to contribute everywhere I could and sought out unglamorous tasks in order to add value to the project.
    </p>
    <div id='sweep_3'>
    <p>
    There are many bugs on the ICANN project related to legacy urls. These bugs include the legacy urls redirecting to the wrong place, uploaded files missing legacy urls, and legacy urls not working for news articles. There has been an exceptional about of meetings this week and conversations via Hip Chat on how to resolve the bugs. While I am not naive enough to think I can join a project and fix a bug this complex, I have tried to look for <mark>unglamorous task</mark> as a way to contribute. These tasks included participating and attending late and long meetings, reading all the hip chat conversations, and being a good partner while pairing with Alex. Reading hip chat conversations and attending meetings after 6 o&#39;clock may not seem glamorous, but is essential to me being a part of the team. While I did not contribute much to the meetings, I felt that after the meetings when Alex and I reviewed what was talked about, we both had a better understanding of how the bugs could be fixed.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
    While pairing with Alex this week, I spent the majority of the time as the navigator. In pair programming, the navigator&#39;s job is to review the code and offer suggestions for possible solutions and refactoring. I felt like I contributed and caught one or two things here and there that might have come back to be a larger issue. I feel being a navigator was a great way for me to get an introduction to the code while still contributing.
    </p>
    <div id='growth_3'>
    <p>
    I started using Vim this week and have committed to using it 100 percent. Vim is a text editor that is known for its efficiency and steep learning curve. Learning and using Vim is my illustration of having a <mark>growth mindset</mark>. I know today I am not an expert at Vim, but I am better than I was on Monday, and I know I will be much better by the time my apprenticeship is over. I feel it is important for me to learn Vim so I can sit down with any pair and feel comfortable driving.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
    The combination of using Vim and learning Ember has made my personal project an extremely valuable learning tool. If I was pairing during my personal project, undoubtedly my pair would grow frustrated from my mistyping. However, since I don't have to pair, I don't mind taking an extended amount of time to write a short bit of code as long as I am practicing my Vim skills.
    </p>
    <div id='construct_3'>
    <p>
    My illustration of <mark>constructing my own curriculum</mark> this week is my continued attempt to learn as much about Ember as possible. Debugging Ember has grown to be very frustrating because the errors Ember displays aren&#39;t as descriptive as one would prefer. Ember is also constantly being developed and many of the solutions to errors found on stack overflow are not up to date. Even though debugging and searching through Stack Over Flow for answers is very frustrating and misleading, I am very fortunate to have my mentor Alex and Matt Jones who are more than helpful when asked Ember questions. It is extremely rewarding when Ember works and everything finally falls into place perfectly, and I am very happy with my progress so far.

      It has been one month since I started as an apprentice at Neo, and this is a good time to look in the mirror and give an <mark>accurate self-assessment</mark>. This month is also the one year anniversary of applying to DevBoot Camp and thus the first time I ever opened the terminal.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div id='long_4'>
      <p>
      I recognize that I have traveled just a short distance on the <mark>long road</mark> to becoming a developer, but I am satisfied knowing that I am on the correct path. I will refrain from listing all the great new tools I have acquired since beginning my apprenticeship. My goal is not to have a laundry list of skills or frameworks that I can list off to people. I will however illustrate the new outlook in life that I learned from the coding community and how my goals have changed since joining the coding community. Previous to Neo and programming I was a trader. My goal everyday was to make as much money as possible and crush all other traders by any means necessary. Today I have new goals as a developer.
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
      Making a career change from a senior trader to a software development apprentice has not been an easy one, but it has been a fulfilling experience and has opened my self up to a new level of empathy towards others.  In my previous life as a trader, I was forced to compared myself to everyone on the trading floor and in most cases I hoped everyone would fail so I could be at the top. At my desk (and every other trader's desk) I would have a scoreboard of every trader and the amounts each trader made that day, and I of course wanted to be at the top of that scoreboard. Never would I have ever subscribed to any of the principles of Apprenticeship Patterns, especially the notion that comparison is only useful to help others improve. Yes, I still am competitive and I still need to make money to keep a roof over my head, but I no longer think I have to achieve those things at the expense of another person. I can't speak for the entire coding community, but I feel the collective voice might say: we are all on the same road; why not assist each other in achieving success?
      </p>
      <p>
      My goal is not to be better at coding than any other developer, or have a longer list of skills that I know. My goals now are to be better than I was the previous day at programming, improve the rate at which I learn new skills, and seek to help my fellow programmers in areas where they may struggle. In the book Apprenticeship Patterns, the authors say the only time comparing ourselves to others is useful is only when it allows us to find ways to help each other improve. A good example of this has been my interaction with the other apprentice, James. Would it be healthy or effective to compare myself to James every day and keep a list of things he was better than me and try to beat him at those things? In my opinion, no. Instead, a better approach would be to compare myself with James to see what he is good at, ask him for help in those areas, and see what skills he is lacking, then help him develop those skills. We achieve this by regularly comparing our personal projects and lending assistance to each other when we can. We are both on the same road, so why not assist each other in the process?
      </p>
      <p>
      One of the main reasons I have achieved growth as an apprentice is because the coding community is so gracious to beginners and the people at Neo are open to giving out knowledge that they worked hard to acquire. An illustration of this has been the progress I have made on my personal project. My personal project is an app that lets people create and organize a tournament. I am using the Rails and Ember frameworks. My goal last friday was to implement an authentication system using Devise. Simply let a user login, store their session, and then log out. Seems simple, however, I quickly learned I would go down a worm hole that would last all day.
      </p>
      <p>
      My first goal was to create a user, then later I would figure out how to deal with sessions. I created a user on the Ember client side, but I knew I was doing it completely wrong. I could tell you the specifics, but to keep a long story short, I was sending the unencrypted password and user information back and forth from Ember to Rails. I was, however, creating a user, so goal complete. On to how to deal with sessions. Wrong! Storing an unencrypted password is a BIG no no for obvious security reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
      I knew I was doing something (if not everything) wrong, and it was definitely time to seek assistance. I looked for guidance from our resident Ember pros Matt Jones and Tony Schneider. After explaining my goal and where I was at, I got a similar sarcastic response, "Thats all you want to do?" Clearly, this was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. Matt and Tony both agreed that using Devise&#39;s generated Rails views and database authentication techniques would be best and to scrap the mess that I had made.
      </p>
      <p>
      I returned to my work station with the new goal of using Devise on the client side. I thought maybe I could just have a link to the Devise sign up view on the Ember side, such as  href="/users/sign_in" Sign in . This almost works. The Devise view is being rendered 'on top' of the Ember template, but I am able to login and a session is created. I can create a user with an encrypted password and resign them in. All of the Devise authentication functionality is working as it normally would. However, the Ember templates and Rails views are intwined and being viewed all on one page. An example of what a url would be is: localhost:3000/users/sign_up/#/players. Matt and Tony explained that I needed to separate Ember and Rails. Frustrating news for myself. After weeks of trying to configure them to work together I would need to now separate them.
      </p>
      <p>
      After trying different solutions myself for an hour or so, I concluded that I did not know how to do this and didn't even know where to begin. I headed straight for Matt and Tony. They both didn't know the answer right off the top of their heads, but they directed me to the repository for the T-2 project. T-2 is an internal app made by Neo that is used for allocation and project assignment. T-2 is was written using both Ember and Rails. The idea that two developers would let me look at their work to learn from it and use it is still foreign to me.
      </p>
      <div id='learning_4'>
      <p>
      This behavior would never happen in the financial world. In this example in the world of Wall Street, Matt and Tony would probably deliberately lead me down the wrong path. This is just one of many reasons I find the coding community to be so great. I wasn&#39;t told to look at their work so I could steal it, rather I was told to look at their work with the untold understanding that someday, someone would ask me how to do this same task and I could teach them… <mark>a snowball effect of knowledge</mark>.
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
      The answer to my question lay in the asset pipeline. I need to create separate manifest files for my Rails views to use and for my Ember templates to use. In my Rails manifests, I would remove all signs of Ember. I also needed to configure a way for when the user signs up or logs in, that they are redirected to the Ember portion of the app. Additionally, I created a Rails view that will act as my project root landing page with links to both the log in and sign up. Once a user signs up or logs in, they get redirected to the Ember client side templates for the tournament and the games. A new session is created, and when they log out, the session is cleared.
      </p>
      <p>
      With the help of Matt and Tony, my goal for the day is complete. I now can&#39;t wait until someone asks me how to create authentication so I can point them to my repository page and the knowledge snowball can continue on.
      </p>
      <p>
      Looking forward to next week!

      <p>
      Driving back and forth from Columbus to Chicago every weekend gives me 12-14 hours by myself to think. During these trips, my mind drifts, and I often reflect on how different my life was only one year ago. My mind also drifts as I reminisce about how I thought my life path would be when I graduated college. I remember thinking I would move to Chicago, become a big time trader, live a wealthy lifestyle, marry, have kids, retire and live happily ever after. I did not forecast that one day I would wake up and say to myself, "I cannot trade anymore." I hated it. I hated everything about it. I could not stomach going into work as a trader. I knew I needed to change careers.
      </p>
      <p>
      At that time I had worked as a trader for close to seven years, and I was frustrated and burnt out with the day to day grind; working 80 hours a week, sometimes more. I was even more frustrated because I didn&#39;t feel like I had contributed to society, and I certainly never had that fulfilling feeling after putting in so much time and effort after a long day at work.
      </p>
      <p>
      The moment I knew I couldn&#39;t trade anymore was a scary day. Regrettably, I did not have a plan B. I did not have a skill or interest I was improving and learning on the side as I was trading. Trading is all I knew how to do. I had no contacts outside of the trading community in Chicago. What were my other skills? Should I go back to school? What was my wife going to think when I tell her I was leaving trading? There was an unlimited list of uncertainties. I wish I had taken the time years earlier to make a plan if trading did not work out. I regret not sitting down and listing interest and jobs that I could potentially see on my horizon and construct a curriculum on how to learn those skills.
      </p>
      <p>
      I regret not realizing that just because I wanted or expected my career path to turn out a certain way, there would be a good chance that it wouldn&#39;t.
      </p>
      <p>
      A lot of stars had to fall in line for me to be at Neo and writing this blog post today. I am extremely fortunate that I am on the path I am on now. While a trader, I developed an interest for programming, but I never did anything with that interest. I would just look at the programmers and say, "Wow that looks awesome!" The first time I opened the command line wasn&#39;t until a year ago. I knew that programming was something I had an interest in but no experience. While applying to Dev BootCamp, they made me do all the Code Academy and Code School Ruby lessons and also the Hartl tutorial before I could even apply. They kept asking "how do you know you want to code if you've never written any code?" I didn&#39;t have that answer. I just knew I wanted to make something and use my brain in ways I hadn&#39;t in years. I was eager to learn again. Luckily, I showed enough enthusiasm in coding to get invited to go visit DevBoot Camp and to be considered as an applicant. I made up my mind and set a goal to be a programmer. I was fortunate that a Dev BootCamp recently opened in Chicago to help expedite that process. Next, I will apply, and I will get in. But what if that didn&#39;t happen? What if I didn&#39;t get accepted into DevBoot Camp? What if I didn&#39;t have $12,000 to attend to DevBoot Camp? What if my wife one day said, "This is crazy- you are not leaving trading!"? I do not know where my life would be or what I would be doing.
      </p>
      <p>
      I am not writing this as a suggestion for people to panic and start learning a totally new skill besides programming. I love programming and I love my job, but maybe you don&#39;t. I still have people approach me today telling me how much they want to be a trader and how they would kill for a job and life as a trader. If those people love trading that much, then my suggestion is go be a trader. Learn the skills to be a trader and go to the Board of Trade and become a trader. Trading is just not for me. Everyone has their own path. I am writing this as a cautionary tale. If you feel like your career path is not fulfilling or if you feel frustrated or at a road block, try <mark>this exercise</mark> from the book Apprenticeship Patterns. I wish I would have.
      </p>
      <div id='own_map_5'>
      <p>
      "List three jobs that you think you could do following your current one. Then list three jobs each of those could lead to. Take a hard look at all 12 jobs. Is this really the full range of desirable jobs for the next few years of your life? Is there something missing? Extend this diagram by adding three jobs for each of the nine jobs you recently added. This should increase the number of jobs in your diagram by 27. Ask yourself if this set of jobs is more representative of the range of career options you have and the places you want to take your career. What are the constraints that are limiting your options?"
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
      I would expand on that exercise and say to start creating a curriculum to the learn skills needed to acquire a job in that field. I am still on that step, I am still constructing a curriculum and learning skills to become a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
      We could make a hypothetical situation with Rails. What if Ruby on Rails becomes obsolete in favor of something else? It might be a good exercise to replace the word job with framework or language in the above exercise. "List three frameworks that you think you could use following the current one. Then list three languages each of those could lead to." Would it be a smart decision to start learning those frameworks or languages just in case Rails becomes obsolete? For me, I am focusing on Rails and Ember at the moment, but still conscious of Clojure as something to start looking into.
      </p>
      <p>
      Luckily, programmers are constantly learning new skills and have the ability to learn quickly. Programmers have a mind frame of continuously expanding their knowledge, and with that mind frame, any change to the landscape of programming or your career path can be quickly absorbed.
      </p>
      <div id='road_5'>
      <p>
      The above did not have a lot to do with my apprenticeship; just the <mark>road that led me Neo</mark>. Having an apprenticeship has been a great experience and has solidified that I want to pursue a career as a developer. If I really did not enjoy programming or working at Neo, there is no chance I would be away from my wife for five days and commuting back and forth from Chicago. The fact that I am eager to get to work and truly have been enjoying my apprenticeship has solidified that I made the correct decision to change careers. I&#39;m so happy I did!

          <i>“How long will it take to master aikido?” a prospective student asks. “How long do you expect to live?” is the only respectable response.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        —George Leonard
        </p>
        <p>
        I took this quote from Apprenticeship Patterns, one could substitute the word aikido for the words software craftsmanship.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have realized that the more I know about software craftsmanship, the more I realize I don&#39;t know. When I graduated from DevBoot Camp, I was on top of the world. I thought I knew Ruby and Rails, Sinatra, Jquery and Rspec. I was ready to hit the scene and skate into an 85 thousand a year job. Looking back, it is funny to think how much I really didn’t know.
        </p>
        <div id='self'>
          <p>
            I was smart enough however to realize through an <mark>accurate self-assessment</mark> that I needed an apprenticeship to fill in all the gaps in all the areas that I didn&#39;t know. Thankfully, I found a great apprenticeship program at Neo. Everyday while pairing at Neo it is both overwhelming and extremely rewarding being exposed to so many new things about software craftsmanship. It is overwhelming because there is so much to learn. It is extremely rewarding because I know everyday that I walk into work I will learn more than every other person at work. This is an example of a growth mindset. I should not dwell on all the topics I have little knowledge of. I should look at all those topics with enthusiasm. I am in the best position possible to learn and with enough work, I will learn that topic. I have worked for 7 weeks on my personal project with the goal being in the end to know Ember. Depending on your definition of knowing, I will probably never fully ‘know’ Ember by the time my apprenticeship is over. I will however have a better understanding of Ember and that should be the goal, know more today than I did yesterday.

          <p>
            A principle closely tied to expose your ignorance is the principle of <mark>confronting you ignorance</mark>. Confronting your ignorance is the action step. Once you have identified your ignorance in a subject, you need to confront it and start learning about that subject. Yes, you can expose your ignorance and do nothing about it. Myself, along with many people, are guilty of this when Rails does something awesome and we say ‘That’s the magic of Rails!’ without figuring out exactly what Rails is doing.

        Before this week I had never dug into the source code of a gem or a framework. I am guilty of being content with not knowing how something works and not doing anything about it.
        </p>
        <p>
        On Friday while working on my personal project, a tournament generating app, I confronted my ignorance and dug into the source code of Devise with Alex. My goal for the day on Friday was to implement a Twitter Oauth strategy. I wanted to login and authenticate a user via Twitter, create a user record if they already do not have a user account, and map attributes from their Twitter profile to attributes in their newly created user record. By mid-afternoon, I was able to complete the first two objectives, but I was not able to create a user record. The problem was that Twitter will not include the users email information in the Json hash that they send back and there is no way to request it. This is a problem because when a user is created, one of the validation checks Devise has is that the email field must be present to create a user. So every time I was trying to create a user, it was not persisting because the email field was nil. I found the answer to my question on a stack overflow post... simply add the following code to your user model:
        </p>
        <div id="code">
          <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
              def email_required?<br>
              <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
              false<br>
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
                end
              </p>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        A user is can now login through Twitter, and if they do not have a user record, one is made with attributes are mapped from their Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
        What about this email_required? method? I am exposing my ignorance. I do not know where it is coming from, I’m just glad it works. I need to confront my ignorance and track down where this method is coming from. Alex showed me how to open the source code for the Devise gem and track down the email_required? method and see exactly what the method is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
        The method is found in the validatable model at devise/lib/devise/models/validatable.rb. The first evidence is found on line 29 when the following is called validates_presence_of :email, if: :email_required? On line 57 we see the full method.
        </p>
        <div id="code">
          <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
              def email_required?<br>
              <p style="text-indent: 5em;">
              true<br>
              </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 3em;">
                end
              </p>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        In this example, the email_required? method was not difficult to read or to change and was a good first exercise in going through source code to see how exactly a gem is wired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confronting our ignorance is difficult because it requires extra effort. That extra push can be very rewarding and lead you into new areas you might not have entered previously. My new knowledge of how Devise works and where to find the internal methods has lead me to think what other methods in Devise I can customize?
        </p>
        <div id='construct'>
          <p>
            In the coming week I plan to confront my ignorance about software analytics. Software analytics is a topic that I have overheard developers at Neo talking about numerous times and I have not yet taken the action of learning about it. The first step in learning about software analytics is to <mark>construct a curriculum</mark> of articles, videos, and books about the subject. The next step is to implement analytics into my personal project or other breakable toys that I have. A breakable toy is described in Apprenticeship Patterns as toy systems that are similar in toolset, but not in scope to the systems you build at work. By the end of the week I might not know a lot about software analytics but I will know more than I do today.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Looking forward to next week!

        The authors of Apprenticeship Patterns describe <mark>concrete</mark> tools as the base level tools needed by an apprentice so they can be put to good use and do not require ‘day care.’ For me, the concrete skills I need to acquire and hone are the detailed parts of programing. My goal is at the end of my apprenticeship is to take an idea and write the code in the most efficient way possible. It is frustrating to know the steps of a large process only having to be side tracked because I don’t know what the proper syntax is. A good example is when setting the default value of a boolean in the migration, is it written as a string or not? My momentum and focus is side tracked because of these little, yet important, tasks that I have to reference. By the end of my apprenticeship, I hope syntax becomes second nature.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        My mentor, Felix, asked me to write down all the things I knew and all the things I didn’t know about programming. This was done in an effort to focus on the things I didn’t know in the coming weeks as an apprentice.
        </p>
        <p>
        My answer related to the quote above taken from Apprenticeship Patterns. I feel I have a broad brush stroke of knowledge about programming languages and frameworks, but I lack the individual detailed skills that I need to be the best programmer I can be.This week, I was tasked with having to create and populate glossary term models with information located in a CSV file.  The first step was to create a Rake task to import a CSV file full or terms, definitions, and acronyms. The second step was to create a new glossary term model and map the information from the CSV file to the attributes in the glossary term object.
        </p>
        <p>
        I feel confident that I have the knowledge of the steps I needed to take to accomplish the task. However, when implementing these steps, I made syntax errors and had to fix my implementation multiple times. This was inefficient and frustrating. In the end I did accomplish the task and with further practice, repetition, and a deeper understanding of the concrete skills needed to be a Ruby on Rails developer, I should be able to improve on my process.
        </p>
        <div id='construct_your_curriculum'>
        <p>
        Working on my concrete skills and having a deeper knowledge of Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript need to happen before I can take the next step into an efficient developer. I feel the best way to improve those concrete skills is to <mark>construct a curriculum</mark> involving the book 'Best of Ruby Quiz'. 'Best of Ruby Quiz' is a book filled with twenty five programming puzzles. During the first three weeks at Dev BootCamp the curriculum is mainly focused on problems similar to the ones found in the book 'Best of Ruby Quiz'. Examples of these problems include making a program to convert words into numbers or to write a program to correctly fill in a Sudoku board. Since the first three weeks of Dev BootCamp, I have not done my share of programming puzzles or coding katas. I have focused more on the broad picture of languages and frameworks and created applications mainly in Ember. I need to revisit my base languages, Ruby and JavaScript, working on my skills in an effort to make creation of larger projects more efficient.

        When I was a basketball player growing up, all I heard was <mark>"practice, practice, practice."</mark> In high school and college I would have a routine of shooting 300 jump shots a day, along with dribbling drills, sprints, and 50 pull ups on the chin-up bar. I did this everyday, along with attending the scheduled practices. I did this so when it came time for the game, I would be ready. I made and corrected my mistakes during all my hours of alone practice, so in the games I wouldn’t make those same mistakes. This concept can be related to programming professionally. If I do enough projects and problems on the side, I will learn from the mistakes made in programming "practice" and not in the programming "game" at work. The analogy here is the side projects are the hours of practice and the work done on a client&#39;s project is the game. In Apprenticeship Patterns, the authors suggest that fixing the all mistakes made while doing side projects is a type of TDD for your brain. Create a program, figure out why it is not working, and rewrite the program until it is done correctly. This process rewires your brain over and over teaching you the correct way. By routinely visiting the ‘Best of Ruby Quiz’ book and doing the problems both in JavaScript and Ruby, I plan to minimize (and hopefully eliminate) syntax errors.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        This is not to say errors and mistakes are forbidden. They happen often, even to the most experienced programmers. Syntax errors are self inflicted and can be corrected through practice. I realize through my own self evaluation that for myself to take the next step to junior developer, syntax mistakes need to be minimized, and through practice, I hope to achieve that.

        Below is an excerpt from the Scientific American article 'The Expert Mind.' I found the excerpt on practice and pushing yourself both valuable and inspiring.

        <p>
        <i>"Ericsson argues that what matters is not experience per se but "effortful study," which entails continually tackling challenges that lie just beyond one's competence. That is why it is possible for enthusiasts to spend tens of thousands of hours playing chess or golf or a musical instrument without ever advancing beyond the amateur level and why a properly trained student can overtake them in a relatively short time. It is interesting to note that time spent playing chess, even in tournaments, appears to contribute less than such study to a player's progress; the main training value of such games is to point up weaknesses for future study."</i>

        <p>
          This week I was tasked with the challenge of making a jQuery plugin. A jQuery plugin is a method that extends jQuery prototype object. When extended to the jQuery prototype, all jQuery objects will have access to this new method. Anytime a jQuery object is created that object has access to a set of methods that all jQuery objects share, these methods include .css();, .append();, .filter();, etc.. Additionally when an HTML element is selected using the $ function such as $(‘a’) a jQuery object is returned and has access to those same methods. The method that I will extend onto the jQuery prototype object is called .referenceSection();.
        </p>
        <p>
          The .referenceSection(); plugin will scan a page and add reference’s to every element on the page that is part of the ‘.rs’ class. The plugin will make a reference section at the bottom of the page with all the elements in the ‘.rs’ class, listed with either their url or text along side a brief description.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally the plugin will append a numbered superscript to the url. When a user hovers over the superscript it will reveal the description. When the superscript is clicked the user will go to the location of the description in the reference section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we get started please <a class="label label-danger" href='http://referencesection.herokuapp.com/'>demo the referenceSection(); plugin.</a></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          With this task I felt like I was thrown into the deep end. Prior to this task my experience with using jQuery plugins was limited and usually resulted in me failing when attempting to add them to my projects. Now I had to create a plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the type of challenge that I love and requested from Felix. I learn the most and gain the most confidence when stretched beyond my comfort zone. Its a great feeling not knowing anything about a subject, diving head first into it, and coming out the other side with new found skills and confidence. It also helps that I have a great support system at Neo, when I am stuck I can just ask them and they are more then willing to share how they would solve to problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          When faced with a daunting large task it is best to break the large task up into small incrementing tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feature list for referenceSection(); plugin:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Configure and seed. [ ]</li>
          <li>Create reference section beneath the body. [ ]</li>
          <li>In reference section list superscripts containing the index of each element in reference section. [ ]</li>
          <li>In reference section next to the superscripted index list the raw url if element is a link, if not a link list the text encapsulated inside the element. [ ]</li>
          <li>In reference section list the description for each element next to the raw url/text. [ ]</li>
          <li>Each element in the body that is part of the reference section should have an appended superscripted index value. [ ]</li>
          <li>In the body when the superscript is clicked the page should scroll to the correct corresponding description in reference section. [ ]</li>
          <li>In the reference section when the superscript is clicked the page should scroll to the correct corresponding link in the body. [ ]</li>
          <li>In the body when a user hovers over the superscript the description of the link should appear in a quote bubble. [ ]</li>
          <li>Refactor. [ ]</li>
          <li>Make demo site featuring plugin. [ ]</li>
          <li>Make Public: Register with jQuery plugin registry. [ ]</li>
          <li>Maintain and update versions. [ ]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The overall task was to create a plugin but the first step is to configure an index.html page, application.css file and application.js file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The index.html file is seeded with lorem ipsum. Lorem ipsum is placeholder text used for demonstration purposes. For my purposes I needed 5 paragraphs with 6 links and a 'div' tag that encapsulates a set of text, such as &lt;div&gt; Ben Franklin &lt;/div&gt;. We will use these links and the 'div' tag to test our plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step is to create and application.js file to hold all the javascript. Include that file in your the index.html file. A good way to know you have configured your project correctly is to include <i>console.log('I am ready');</i> in your application.js file. Refresh the index.html page and open the inspector you should see <i>I am ready</i>. In the Chrome browser to open the inspector hold command-option and hit j. Similarly a good way to know you have configured the CSS file correctly is to select the paragraphs, 'p' tags, and change the color to red, when refreshed the paragraphs should be red. Once the files are configured correctly, create a git repository and push the added files.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I stated previously all jQuery objects share methods, the methods come from the $.fn object. The $.fn object contains all the methods and that is where we want to extend the .referenceSection(); method onto. We do this by attaching .referenceSection(); to $.fn.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          $.fn.referenceSection = function(){};
        </pre></code>
        <p>
        The application.js file should read:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          $.fn.referenceSection = function () {};

          $(document).ready(function () {
              $("body").referenceSection();
          });
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          The .referenceSection(); function is created and then called on the HTML element body when the DOM is loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
        To protect the use on the $ alias and to create additional scope we need to put the .referenceSection(); method inside an immediately-invoked function expression and pass the function jQuery, and name the parameter $. Wrapping the code inside an immediately-invoked function also provides scope and lets use set local variables if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
        The application.js file should read:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          (function ($) {
              $.fn.referenceSection = function () {

                  return this;
              };
          }(jQuery));

          $(document).ready(function () {
              $("body").referenceSection();
          });
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          Users of the referenceSection(); plugin will be required to select each element they want to put in the reference section and label them with a class of '.rs'. A user will also be required to insert a data-info attribute within the tag. The data-info attribute will hold the description of the element being referenced in the reference section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of how the elements should look are as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            &lt;a class='rs' href='http://www.neo.com/' data-info="Neo delivers exceptional software with robust engineering."&gt;Neo&lt;/a&gt;

            or

            &lt;span class='rs' data-info="Founding father of the US"&gt;Ben Franklin&lt;/span&gt;
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          Our goal is to figure out how to isolate all of the elements in the body of the document that are part of the ‘.rs’ class. jQuery provides many methods for traversing and selecting elements in the DOM. The .find(); method will be used inside the .referenceSection(); method to select and iterate through each ‘.rs’ element. The code for finding and iterating through each ‘.rs’ element is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          this.find( ".rs" ).each(function() {});
        </pre></code>
        <p>
        I like to use the jQuery .css(); method to test that I am selecting the correct elements. Place the following $('.rs').css('color', 'green'); inside the each loop. Placing this .css(); code inside the each loop should change all the '.rs' tags the color green. If it doesn’t you are missing a piece of code. Remove $('.rs').css('color', 'green'); from the each loop.
        </p>
        <p>
        The application.js file should read:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          (function ($) {
              $.fn.referenceSection = function () {

                  this.find(".rs").each(function () {

                  });

                  return this;
              };
          }(jQuery));

          $(document).ready(function () {
              $("body").referenceSection();
          });
        </pre></code>
        <p>
        Inside the each loop is where we will eventually manipulate and append each element in the '.rs' class with a superscript. The superscript will be displayed as the numbered index of the element. The numbered superscript will also be a link that will point to the corresponding description of the element in the reference section. The reference section will be appended below the body. Each description in the reference section will be numbered and the url shown with a description.
        </p>
        <p>
        Next step is to create the reference section.
        </p>
        <p>
        Append to the 'body' the reference section that will hold the numbered url and description. This will be done using the .append(); jQuery method.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          $( "body" ).append("&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id='reference'&gt;Reference Section&lt;/h3&gt;");
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          The application.js file should read:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          (function ($) {

              $.fn.referenceSection = function () {
                  $( "body" ).append("&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id='reference'&gt;Reference Section&lt;/h3&gt;");

                  this.find(".rs").each(function () {

                  });

                  return this;
              };
          }(jQuery));

          $(document).ready(function () {
              $("body").referenceSection();
          });
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          Refresh your browser you should have a ‘Reference Section’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our next step is to iterate through each element that is part of the ‘.rs’ class. If the selected element in the ‘.rs’ class is a link we will use the raw url that is stored in the 'href' attribute as the label for the element in the reference section. If the element is not a link we will use the encapsulated text as the label for the element in the reference section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the each loop of the .reference(); method, console.log ‘this’. When you console.log(this); Each element that is part of the ‘.rs’ class should be shown in the console. You should see 6 'a' tags along with one 'div' tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘this’ is a very important concept of Javascript and there are many resources on the internet explaining the scope of ‘this’ and its importance, I would recommend reviewing them. I have developed the habit of using console.log to determine 'this' when I am in doubt of what ‘this’ is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set ‘this’ to a variable called 'element'.  The variable ‘element’ will now hold the element in the ‘.rs’ class that is being iterated over and all of its attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step is to figure out a way to access the ‘href’ attribute if the varibale element is a link, the ‘href’ is an attribute inside of the 'a' tag that holds the raw url.
        </p>
        <p>
          jQuery comes with the .attr(); method that gets or sets attributes of elements. We will use the .attr(); method to extract the ‘href’ from the element if it is a link. Set the extracted ‘href’ to a local variable named ‘href’.
        </p>
        <p>
          jQuery come with another helpful method that we will use to get the encapsulated text from the element. We will use this text if the element is not a link. The jQuery method that we will use for this purpose is .text();. Set the extracted ‘text’ to a local variable named ‘text.’
        </p>
        <p>
        The application.js file should read:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          (function ($) {

                $.fn.referenceSection = function () {
                    $( "body" ).append("&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id='reference'&gt;Reference Section&lt;/h3&gt;");

                    this.find(".rs").each(function () {
                      var element = $( this );
                      var href = element.attr("href");
                      var text = element.text();

                    });

                    return this;
                };
            }(jQuery));

            $(document).ready(function () {
                $("body").referenceSection();
            });
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          Inside the each loop we now we have the local variable ‘href’ that contains the raw url, we can now construct a list of the raw urls from each ‘a’ tag and append them into the reference section. If the element is not a link we will use the text encapsulated in the element rather than the raw url, that text is stored in the local variable ‘text.’
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we build out the reference section lets find the index value of each element is in the‘.rs’ class. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Set variable 'i' outside of the each loop starting at 1, and after each loop increment the 'i' variable by one. The short hand to increment a variable by one is, ++i;.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          (function ($) {

                $.fn.referenceSection = function () {
                    $( "body" ).append("&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id='reference'&gt;Reference Section&lt;/h3&gt;");
                    var i = 1

                    this.find(".rs").each(function () {
                      var element = $( this );
                      var href = element.attr("href");
                      var text = element.text();

                      ++i;
                    });

                    return this;
                };
            }(jQuery));

            $(document).ready(function () {
                $("body").referenceSection();
            });
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          We can see we now have created three important variables that we need for our plugin. The variable ‘href’ that holds the raw url, the variable ‘text’ that holds the encapsulated text and the variable ‘i’ that holds the index for each ‘.rs’ class element. With these three variables we can construct the list of references in the reference section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creat a variable ‘label’ that will be the the label of our element in the reference section. The conditional for the value of label reads; if ‘href’ is null or undefined set label to the variable 'text', if ‘href’ is not null or undefined and therefore the element is a link, the value of ‘label’ is ‘href.’
        </p>
        <pre><code>
           var label = href === null || href === undefined ? text : href
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          Each element in the reference section will be an &lt;li&gt; list element. We can hard code the creation of an HTML &lt;li&gt; element and place that inside of the each loop. Using the jQuery append(); method we can attach the &lt;li&gt; element  to the ‘body.’
        </p>
        <p>
        The list item that is placed inside of the each loop looks like:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          $( "body" ).append("&lt;li id="+i+"&gt;"+"&lt;sup&gt;"+"[" + i + "]"+"&lt;/sup&gt;"+ " "+label+ ":" + "&lt;/li&gt;");
        </pre></code>
        <p>
        The &lt;sup&gt; is the superscript tag. The variable ‘i’ is used twice once in the 'id' of the &lt;li&gt; tag and again inside of the &lt;sup&gt; tag surrounded by brackets.
        </p>
        <p>
        The application.js file should read:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          (function ($) {

                $.fn.referenceSection = function () {
                    $( "body" ).append("&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id='reference'&gt;Reference Section&lt;/h3&gt;");
                    var i = 1

                    this.find(".rs").each(function () {
                      var element = $( this );
                      var href = element.attr("href");
                      var text = element.text();
                      var label = href === null || href === undefined ? text : href

                      $( "body" ).append("&lt;li id="+i+"&gt;"+"&lt;sup&gt;"+"[" + i + "]"+"&lt;/sup&gt;"+ " "+label+ ":" + "&lt;/li&gt;");

                      ++i;
                    });

                    return this;
                };
            }(jQuery));

            $(document).ready(function () {
                $("body").referenceSection();
            });
        </pre></code>
        <p>
        Refresh the page, you should have a reference section with a numbered list of each element in the '.rs' class along with their url or text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets look at the list of features for this plugin and determine what we have done and what we need to do:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Configure and seed. [X]</li>
          <li>Create reference section beneath the body. [X]</li>
          <li>In reference section list superscripts containing the index of each element in reference section. [X]</li>
          <li>In reference section next to the superscripted index list the raw url if element is a link, if not a link list the text encapsulated inside the element. [X]</li>
          <li>In reference section list the description for each element next to the raw url/text. [ ]</li>
          <li>Each element in the body that is part of the reference section should have an appended superscripted index value. [ ]</li>
          <li>In the body when the superscript is clicked the page should scroll to the correct corresponding description in reference section. [ ]</li>
          <li>In the reference section when the superscript is clicked the page should scroll to the correct corresponding link in the body. [ ]</li>
          <li>In the body when a user hovers over the superscript the description of the link should appear in a quote bubble. [ ]</li>
          <li>Refactor. [ ]</li>
          <li>Make demo site featuring plugin. [ ]</li>
          <li>Make Public: Register with jQuery plugin registry. [ ]</li>
          <li>Maintain and update versions. [ ]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Next lets attach each ‘.rs’ class element in the ‘body’ with a superscript of the index value. We will accomplish this similarly to how we attached the superscript inside of the reference section. We can reuse the variable ‘i’, we will also be using the variable ‘element’ which is set to ‘this’.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          element.after(" "+ "&lt;a href="+"#"+i+"&gt;" + "&lt;sup&gt;" + "[" + i + "]"+ "&lt;/sup&gt;" + "&lt;/a&gt;");
        </pre></code>
        <p>
          We use the jQuery method .after(); to attach an ‘a’ tag which contains ‘i’ enclosed inside of a superscript tag. The ‘href’ inside the newly created ‘a’ tag is set to ‘#i’ this will provide the functionality when clicked to scroll to the correct corresponding description in the reference section with the id of ‘i.’ If you remember inside of the reference section we set each list item, &lt;li&gt; to have the id of ‘i’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feature complete, we now have attached each link in the body with a superscript and when that superscript is clicked the page scrolls to the proper element in the reference section.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application.js file should read:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          (function ($) {

                $.fn.referenceSection = function () {
                    $( "body" ).append("&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id='reference'&gt;Reference Section&lt;/h3&gt;");
                    var i = 1

                    this.find(".rs").each(function () {
                      var element = $( this );
                      var href = element.attr("href");
                      var text = element.text();
                      var label = href === null || href === undefined ? text : href

                      element.after(" "+ "&lt;a href="+"#"+i+"&gt;" + "&lt;sup&gt;" + "[" + i + "]"+ "&lt;/sup&gt;" + "&lt;/a&gt;");

                      $( "body" ).append("&lt;li id="+i+"&gt;"+"&lt;sup&gt;"+"[" + i + "]"+"&lt;/sup&gt;"+ " "+label+ ":" + "&lt;/li&gt;");

                      ++i;
                    });

                    return this;
                };
            }(jQuery));

            $(document).ready(function () {
                $("body").referenceSection();
            });
          </pre></code>
          <p>
            We have provided the functionality to allow when a superscript in the 'body' is clicked the page scrolls to the proper 'id' in the reference section. We can reuse that functionality for when we implement the feature for when a superscript is clicked in the reference section.
          </p>
          <p>
            That feature states that the page should scroll up to the correct corresponding element in the body when the superscript is click in the reference section.
          </p>
          <p>
            First add an ‘id’ to the superscript of the elements in the body. Since we have already have HTML elements with the ‘id’ of ‘i’ we need to use something else. Lets set the ‘id’ of each superscript in the ‘body’ with the ‘id’ of ‘i b’. The code for this change is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            element.after(" "+ "&lt;a href="+"#"+i+"&gt;" + "&lt;sup id="+i+"b"+"&gt;" + "[" + i + "]"+ "&lt;/sup&gt;" + "&lt;/a&gt;");
          </pre></code>
          <p>
            In the reference section we need change the superscripted index into a link with an ‘href’ pointing to the correct corresponding element in the body. Lets wrap the existing superscript inside of an ‘a’ tag with an ‘href’ pointing to ‘# i b’. The ‘href’ points to the element in the body with the id of  ‘i b.’
          </p>
          <p>
          The code for this change is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
 $( "body" ).append("&lt;li id="+i+"&gt;"+ "&lt;a href="+"#"+i+"b"+"&gt;" + "&lt;sup&gt;"+"[" + i + "]"+"&lt;/sup&gt;"+ "&lt;/a&gt;" + " "+label+ ":" + "&lt;/li&gt;");
          </pre></code>
          <p>
            The superscript is now a link that points to the HTML element with the ‘id’ of ‘i b’. We can now scroll to and from the link in the body to its description in the reference section.
          </p>
          <p>
          The application.js file should read:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
          (function ($) {

                $.fn.referenceSection = function () {
                    $( "body" ).append("&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id='reference'&gt;Reference Section&lt;/h3&gt;");
                    var i = 1

                    this.find(".rs").each(function () {
                      var element = $( this );
                      var href = element.attr("href");
                      var text = element.text();
                      var label = href === null || href === undefined ? text : href

                      element.after(" "+ "&lt;a href="+"#"+i+"&gt;" + "&lt;sup id="+i+"b"+"&gt;" + "[" + i + "]"+ "&lt;/sup&gt;" + "&lt;/a&gt;");

          <p>
          Lets look at the feature list to see what we still need to accomplish:

          <li>Make Public: Register with jQuery plugin registry. [ ]</li>
          <li>Maintain and update versions. [ ]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We have 2 features to add to the reference plugin and then we need to refactor our work and register the plugin. The features we need to add both involve dealing with the description for each link.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reference plugin will require that the user of the plugin include a data attribute inside the element they want to reference. The data attribute is essentially an attribute that is used as storage of private data.  The 'data-info' attribute will be set inside the element that we want to provide a description of. In the index.html. The following illustrates how to do this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          &lt;a class='rs' href='http://www.neo.com/' data-info="Neo delivers exceptional software with robust engineering."&gt;Neo&lt;/a&gt;

          or

          &lt;span class='rs' data-info="Founding father of the US"&gt;Ben Franklin&lt;/span&gt;
        </pre></code>
        <p>
        Go through your index.html and add the 'data-info' attribute to the elements in your body that are part of the '.rs' class. Leave 1 element without the 'data-info' attribute. We need to account for the situation when a user of the plugin chooses not to add a description to one of their links.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to extract the description housed inside the ‘data-info’ attribute and attach it to the correct corresponding list item in the reference section.
        </p>
        <p>
          To extract the description from the ‘data-info’ attribute we will use the .data(); method provided by jQuery. The .data(); method will let us get or set the data attribute of HTML elements in the DOM. For our purposes we will use the method to get or extract the description stored in the data attribute of each element and set it to the local variable ‘info.’
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the each loop console.log(this);. In the inspector you should see each element in the ‘.rs’ class and all their attributes, including the newly created ‘data-info’ attribute. Create a variable ‘info’ and set it to $( this).data('info'); We can now include the variable ‘info’ after our ‘href’ variable in our reference section, the code is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          var info = $( this).data('info');
        </pre></code>
        <pre><code>
$( "body" ).append("&lt;li id="+i+"&gt;"+ "&lt;a href="+"#"+i+"b"+"&gt;" + "&lt;sup&gt;"+"[" + i + "]"+"&lt;/sup&gt;"+ "&lt;/a&gt;" + " "+label+ ":" + " " +info+ "&lt;/li&gt;");
        </pre></code>
        <p>
        We now have a reference section containing a list. Each list item contains a superscripted index linking to the correct corresponding link in the body, the raw url or text and a description. We have not yet accounted for the situation if the user of the plugin does not provide a description of for a link in the body. Now if the ‘data-info’ is not defined the description is set as ‘undefined.’ We need to put in a guard so if the description is not found it should be set as ‘Description Not Found.’
        </p>
        <p>
        Inside of the each loop we need to create a conditional ‘if’ statement dependent on the variable ‘info.’ If variable ‘info’ is undefined use ‘Description Not Found’ in place of 'info', and if the variable ‘info’ is defined use ‘info’ as the description. The ‘if’ statement should looks like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          if (info !== undefined) {
            $("body").append("&lt;li id=" + i + "&gt;" + "&lt;a href=" + "#" + i + "b" + "&gt;" + "&lt;sup&gt;" + "[" + i + "]" + "&lt;/sup&gt;" + "&lt;/a&gt;"
            + " " + label + ":" + " " + info + "&lt;/li&gt;");
          } else {
            $("body").append("&lt;li id=" + i + "&gt;" + "&lt;sup&gt;" + "[" + i + "]" + "&lt;/sup&gt;" + " " + label + ":" + " " + "Description Not
            Found" + "&lt;/li&gt;");
          }
      </pre></code>
      <p>
       The application.js file should read:
      </p>
      <pre><code>

          <p>
          Having accounted for a link with no ‘data-info’ attribute we can move onto the next item in out features check list.
          </p>
          <p>
          The last feature that we need to include in our reference plugin is in the ‘body’ when a user hovers over the superscript, the description of the element should appear in a quote bubble.
          </p>
          <p>
          For this feature we will use the jQuery .hover(); method on the ’sup’ HTML tag. This hover functionality is put outside the each loop. Inside of the .hover(); function the scope of 'this' is the 'sup' tag that is being hovered over.
          </p>
          <p>
          On the hover over 'this', append a ‘h5’ HTML element to the 'sup' tag with the description of the element being hovered over. To access the ‘data-info’ attribute of the correct element we need to traverse the DOM from the ’sup’ element into the associated element and extract the ‘data-info’ attribute. To do this traversing we use the jQuery traversal method, .parent();. When applied onto 'this' the .parent(); method with give us the parent element of 'this' which is the ‘a’ that encapsulates the 'sup' tag. We have gone one level up the DOM. Our next traversal will be into the immediately preceding sibling element, this element is the element and holds the 'data-info' element. The below variable is the element that holds the description we need to extract.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            var parents_sibling = $( this).parent().prev();
          </pre></code>
          <p>
            Now that we have traversed the DOM and have captured the correct link we can extract the data out of that element the same way we have done previously, using the .data(); method. 
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            var data = parents_sibling.data('info');
          </pre></code>
          <p>
          Append a ‘h5’ onto ‘this’, the ‘sup’ tag.
          </p>
          <p>
          The ‘h5’ should include the 'data' variable. The code is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            $( this ).append( $( "&lt;h5&gt;" +data+ "&lt;/h5&gt;" ) );
          </pre></code>
          <p>
          The next part of the hover function is to remove the ‘h5’ when the mouse leaves the superscript, to do this we :
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            $( this ).find( "h5:last" ).remove();
          </pre></code>
          <p>
          The hover functionality seems to be working but we have applied the functionality to all the superscript tags not just the ones in the ‘body.’ We need a guard to make sure the hover functionality is only applied to superscripts in the ‘body’. A unique feature that our superscripts have in the ‘body’ is that they have a parent and that parent has a sibling with a ‘data attribute’. If we apply the following guard we will only select the superscripts that have an element with a description.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            if ( data !== undefined)
            {
              $( this ).append( $( "&lt;h5&gt;" +data+ "&lt;/h5&gt;" ) );
            }
          </pre></code>
          <p>
          The whole hover function looks like this and should be placed beneath the each loop.
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            $("sup").hover(
              function() {
              var parents_sibling = $( this).parent().prev();
              var data = parents_sibling.data('info');
              if ( data !== undefined)
                {
                  $( this ).append( $( "&lt;h5&gt;" +data+ "&lt;/h5&gt;" ) );
                }
            },function() {
              $( this ).find( "h5:last" ).remove();
            });
          </pre></code>
          <p>
            We still need to add the CSS on the span to make it look like a quote bubble:
          </p>
          <p>
          Add this to your CSS file:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            li {
              list-style-type: none;
            }

            h5 {
              border: 1px solid white;
              background-color: lightgrey;
              color: black;
              border-radius: 25px;
              padding: 5px;
              position: absolute;
              clear: both;
              display: inline-block;
              overflow: hidden;
              white-space: nowrap;
            }
          </pre></code>
          <p>
            Lets check the features checklist for the next feature to implement:
          </p>
          <ol>

        </ol>
        <p>
        Before the refactor this is what your application.js file should look like:
        </p>
      <pre><code>
          (function ($) {

                $.fn.referenceSection = function () {
                    $( "body" ).append("&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 id='reference'&gt;Reference Section&lt;/h3&gt;");
                    var i = 1

                    this.find(".rs").each(function () {
                      var element = $( this );
                      var href = element.attr("href");
                      var text = element.text();
                      var info = $( this).data('info');
                      var label = href === null || href === undefined ? text : href


                      element.after(" "+ "&lt;a href="+"#"+i+"&gt;" + "&lt;sup id="+i+"b"+"&gt;" + "[" + i + "]"+ "&lt;/sup&gt;" + "&lt;/a&gt;");

                      } else {

                        " " + "Description Not Found" + "&lt;/li&gt;");
                      }

                      ++i;
                    });


                    $("sup").hover(
                      function() {
                      var parents_sibling = $( this).parent().prev();
                      var data = parents_sibling.data('info');
                      if ( data !== undefined)
                        {
                          $( this ).append( $( "&lt;h5&gt;" +data+ "&lt;/h5&gt;" ) );
                        }
                    },function() {
                      $( this ).find( "h5:last" ).remove();
                    });


                    return this;
                };
            }(jQuery));

            $(document).ready(function () {
                $("body").referenceSection();
            });
      </pre></code>
      <p>
      The CSS file should read:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        li {
          list-style-type: none;
        }

        h5 {
          border: 1px solid white;
          background-color: lightgrey;
          color: black;
          border-radius: 25px;
          padding: 5px;
          position: absolute;
          clear: both;
          display: inline-block;
          overflow: hidden;
          white-space: nowrap;
        }
      </pre></code>
      <p>
      Time to refactor.
      </p>
      <p>
      Each one of the ‘if’ statements can be broken out and made into their own functions. All repetitive code needs to be broken out into reusable functions. We need to construct a present(); function to make sure a variable is neither ‘undefined’ nor ‘null.’ jQuery also provides a way to construct HTML elements. Once those refactors are done the refactored code should read as follows:
      </p>
        <pre><code>
            (function($){
              $.fn.referenceSection = function() {

                function info_dom(info, index) {
                  var description = present(info.description) ? 'Description Not Found': info.description;
                  var label = present(info.href) ? info.text: info.href;

                  var li = $('&lt;li&gt;', { id:index, text: " " + label +': '});
                  var dom = li.append(description);
                  var a = $('&lt;a&gt;', { href: '#' +index+ 'b'});
                  var super_script = $('&lt;sup&gt;', { text: '[' +index+ ']'});

                  a.append(super_script);
                  dom.prepend(a);

                  return dom;
                };

                function info_attachment(info){
                  var attachment;

                  if ( !present(info)) {
                    attachment = $('&lt;h5&gt;', { text: info });
                  }
                  return attachment;
                };

                function present(val){
                  return val === undefined || val === null
                };

                var i = 1

                this.find( ".rs" ).each(function() {
                  var aTag = $('&lt;a&gt;', { href: "#"+i });
                  var supTag = $('&lt;sup&gt;', { id: i+ "b", text: "[" +i+ "]"});
                  aTag.append(supTag);
                  $(this).after(aTag);

                  info = { href: $(this).attr('href'), description: $( this).data('info'), text: $(this).text()}
                  var dom = info_dom(info, i);
                  $( "body").append(dom);

                  ++i;
                });

                $("sup").hover(
                  function() {
                  var parents_sibling = $( this).parent().prev();
                  var data = parents_sibling.data('info');
                  var attachment = info_attachment(data);
                  $(this).append(attachment);

                },function() {
                  $( this ).find( "h5:last" ).remove();
                });
                return this;
              };}(jQuery));

              $( document ).ready(function() {
                $("body").referenceSection();
              });

        </code></pre>
        <p>
        In this final refactor the 'Reference Section' header is removed in place the list of descriptions is appended to the ‘body’ without a header. The two ‘if’ statements were also broken up into two functions, 'info_dom' and 'info_attachment.' Inside these functions we create the HTML elements.  These functions are then invoked inside of the hover functionality and the each loop. A present(); function is also made to detect both ‘undefined’ and ‘null’ elements.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now we are done lets register this plugin with jQuery so other people can use it. Registering a plugin is surprisingly simple. jQuery provides excelent documentation found here <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/"> : Publishing Your Plugin </a>
        </p>
        <p>
        The only problem that I found was version control. You cannot add to or change a version once it is published. Once you publish a version it is up and any changes need to come in the form of a new version. I changed my code three times and had to make three versions <a href='https://plugins.jquery.com/referencesection/'> in one day.</a> Once I published the first version I changed something minor and had to deploy a whole new version. Be mindful of this so you don’t make the same problem and have multiple versions deployed on the same day.
        </p>
        <p>
        I found registering and creating a demo site very easy and if you run into problems feel free to email me or tweet me and we can figure it out!
